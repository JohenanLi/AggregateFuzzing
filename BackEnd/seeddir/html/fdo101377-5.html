        <pre>Either you have a different problem than me (unlikely, as we have the exact
same symptoms), or you misunderstood my workaround. Or my workaround somehow
doesn't work for you. However, since you talk about actually upgrading the
firmware to a newer version, I'm guessing you didn't understand the workaround.

For my workaround, I neither upgraded nor downgraded any firmware version.
However, Linux 4.8 and Linux 4.9 try to load different files for the same
graphics card. Linux 4.8 loads tonga_smc.bin where as Linux 4.9 loads
tonga_k_smc.bin. Linux 4.8 fully works for me, including 3D acceleration, Linux
4.9 runs into the symptoms you described (black screen, fans running full
speed).

Now, if I replace tonga_k_smc.bin with tonga_smc.bin, then Linux 4.9 _also_
fully works for me, including 3D acceleration. That's without upgrading or
downgrading any firmware files. All I did was this:

cp /lib/firmware/amdgpu/tonga_smc.bin /lib/firmware/amdgpu/tonga_k_smc.bin

Here's the md5sum of all my Tonga firmware files:
fa6590cc9c9c1b2e7c92874fe98460fa  tonga_ce.bin
16bb427918581c29c2e910b5757a1b5b  tonga_k_smc.bin
73befe8abbaa7589d4e701ff77291e62  tonga_k_smc.bin.orig
8ab907852fc93520ad5f0e06dc23298e  tonga_mc.bin
a0fcc61ba211ab74829219a4e2282654  tonga_me.bin
f904f1835656036fd83b0440ddc28528  tonga_mec2.bin
f904f1835656036fd83b0440ddc28528  tonga_mec.bin
89b0391b91ff7159a7b0670c8aace566  tonga_pfp.bin
55f0a189959a11f07d4064a9f96adfb4  tonga_rlc.bin
a61b84ca64068fa6842887a1519ecd4b  tonga_sdma1.bin
8324b832498cb27c0919647df17968b4  tonga_sdma.bin
16bb427918581c29c2e910b5757a1b5b  tonga_smc.bin
fe37ee3d6138cd852215b318cbe65d0a  tonga_uvd.bin
1a81cffe8a10460b8ca9eaad537e7286  tonga_vce.bin

Note that tonga_k_smc.bin and tonga_smc.bin have the same md5sum on my system,
because I copied tonga_smc.bin to tonga_k_smc.bin to make Linux 4.9 work.</pre>
