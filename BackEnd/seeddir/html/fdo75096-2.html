    <pre><i>- file created under OOo crashes calc in LO under 3.5.7.2 in Linux Mint?
</i>No, File created under OOo is fine in LO under 3.5.7.2 in Linux Mint, but crashes under 4.2.0.4 in Vista<i>.

</i>- file created in Vista under 4.2.0.4 crashes when the average function is used?
Yes
But the file you sent is fine!

This is a brand new installation of Vista on an Acer laptop, with all the updates installed.

I tried the following:
Created a new spreadsheet in LO 4.2.0.4 in Vista
Filled A1:A10 with numbers
Saved to USB stick
Opened file on USB stick in LO 3.5.7.2 in Linux Mint
Added =AVERAGE(A1:A10)
Saved to USB stick
Double clicked on file in Windows Explorer, and LO crashed, and wouldn't seem to restart
Restarted Windows computer and started LO 4.2.0.4
Tried to open spreadsheet:
 - It crashed
 - Recovered file and it opened once with Err:522 in the cell were the formula should be
 - All other attempts to open it just resulted in an immediate crash, even after recovery

I've attached this file

        <pre>John, trying to nail down some version specifics:

- file created under OOo crashes calc in LO under 3.5.7.2 in Linux Mint?
- file created in Vista under 4.2.0.4 crashes when the average function is
used?

For reference I have tried this with 4.2.0.4 and Fedora 20 &amp; Windows 7 with no
issues.</pre>
