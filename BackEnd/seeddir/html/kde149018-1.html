        <h1>Konqueror bug #149018 testcase</h1>
        <p>
            According to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visufx.html#visibility ">the CSS 2.1 specification</a>, child elements marked as { visibility: visible } that are inside parent elements marked { visibility: hidden } should still be displayed, even though their parent elements are not.
        </p>
        <p>
            Konqueror handles this correctly, but in the case of links with inline parent elements, the links are shown, but are unresponsive â€” the mouse pointer doesn't change when you hover over them and they do nothing when you click them.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the case where the parent element is a block-level element, the links work properly.  It doesn't matter how deeply the { visibility: hidden } property value has been inherited, it doesn't have to be explicitly specified for the parent element.
        </p>
        <div>
            <span>
                <a href="/">This link is inside an invisible &lt;span> element.</a>
            </span>
        </div>
        <div>
            <a href="/">This link is <em>not</em> inside an invisible &lt;span> element.</a>
        </div>
    </body>
