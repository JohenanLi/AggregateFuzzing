<H2 >Description</H2 >

<P >  QCA is a library that provides an easy API for a range of cryptographic
  features, including SSL/TLS, X.509 certificates, SASL, OpenPGP, smartcards,
  and much more.

<P >  Functionality is supplied via plugins.  This is useful for avoiding
  dependence on a particular crypto library and makes upgrading easier,
  as there is no need to recompile your application when adding or
  upgrading a crypto plugin.

<P >  In order for QCA to be of much use, you will want to install some plugins.

  <P >QCA was originally created to support the security needs of the
  <A HREF="http://psi-im.org/" >Psi XMPP/Jabber client project</A >.
