--- Comment #1 from Frank Reininghaus &lt;<a href="mailto:frank78ac@googlemail.com">frank78ac@googlemail.com</a>&gt; ---<br>
Thanks for the report. Could you elaborate on what exactly you mean with<br>
sharing files/folders with other users? Do you want a way to modify the file<br>
permissions, such that other users can access them?<br>
