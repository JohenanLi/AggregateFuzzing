<html><div>I'm sorry to use your gmail account but don't think my opinion needs to be in bug report..</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I started using kubuntu because I really liked the look (plasma desktop) and feel of it. Also, I am trying to get my children and their children to experience linux using this setup. (five PCs and four different households) Plasma is beautiful but I swapped my laptop to xfce desktop and don't have the problems that plasma does.</div><div>I'm not a expert but it seems that a lot of people use kubuntu the same way as I do.. Running graphical programs as root and all. Seems that the problem shouldn't be shifted to the user but repaired.. I agree with one of the comments in the bug report that if the graphical programs offered a route to root in a menu to edit files and save them that would probably be a decent workaround. But then all of these programs would have to be changed because of this bug?? I vote to fix the problem with this very specific file permission argument.&nbsp; Is it kde or plasma? </div><div>I chowned&nbsp; user:user the file in question and I haven't had this happen again..If this is the fix I will gladly use plasma again.&nbsp; I am glad that you people are working on&nbsp; the problem.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks Allen S</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>---------- Original Message ----------<br>From: Bhushan Shah &lt;bhush94@gmail.com&gt;<br>To: aajmj@juno.com<br>Subject: [plasmashell] [Bug 352542] open file in dolphin while chrome was open plasma desktop disappeared<br>Date: Fri, 11 Sep 2015 07:23:45 +0000<br><br>https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=352542<br><br>Bhushan Shah &lt;bhush94@gmail.com&gt; changed:<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|Removed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|Added<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Status|UNCONFIRMED &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|RESOLVED<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution|--- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|DUPLICATE<br><br>--- Comment #1 from Bhushan Shah &lt;bhush94@gmail.com&gt; ---<br>Don't start graphical application as root.
