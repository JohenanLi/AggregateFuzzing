--- Comment #6 from Frederik Schwarzer &lt;<a href="mailto:schwarzer@kde.org">schwarzer@kde.org</a>&gt; ---<br>
I am sorry but the situation here is unfortunate.<br>
1. since that version, I changed quite some things in KShisen<br>
2. I just started ripping it all apart because many parts of the code are old<br>
and not written by me (so I sometimes do not know how they are supposed to<br>
work)<br>
3. KDevelop refuses to parse the 15.08 version so it does not help me at all<br>
while browsing the code<br>
4. I tried to reproduce today again and failed with around 20 games.<br>
<br>
So, I believe you that there is a problem, but cannot reproduce it, have a hard<br>
time checking the related code for several reasons and also have problems<br>
wrapping my head around that specific code, which made me start a complete<br>
rewrite.<br>
<br>
Do you have any chance to install version 15.12?<br>
