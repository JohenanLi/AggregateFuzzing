<DIV>Oops, didn't mean to poke the bear.&nbsp; No, I just want to know how to 
make them work, including how to use the ones I don't understand.&nbsp; Is there 
another source of info that does not use technical terms to answer technical 
problems?&nbsp; Like,&nbsp;could it&nbsp;tell me exactly what "painting with 
surfaces", not colors, <U>means</U>?&nbsp; And how to access that, in terms of 
"go to this spot and click this/choose that option"?</DIV>
<DIV>I love what I have been able to get the program to do and don't want to 
ditch the thing&nbsp; because I don't understand chunks of it.&nbsp; Much better 
to learn how to work with those tools.</DIV>
<DIV>Thanks</DIV>

href="mailto:boud@valdyas.org">boud@valdyas.org</A>&gt; ---<BR>&gt; If this is 
too abstruse, don't use those brushes. Use other brushes. <BR>&gt; These<BR>&gt; 
brushes are meant for people who need this feature; you don't need <BR>&gt; it, 
don't<BR>&gt; use it! There are very likely more features in Krita that are 
weird <BR>&gt; or<BR>&gt; incomprehensible unless you urgently need them. That 
doesn't mean <BR>&gt; the features<BR>&gt; are buggy, though.<BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; 
-- <BR>&gt; You are receiving this mail because:<BR>&gt; You reported the 
bug.</DIV>
