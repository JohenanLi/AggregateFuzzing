<h1>The background appears in this header.</h1>
<p>
According to the css specification, a fixed background image of any box should be fixed with respect to the canvas. CSS1 paragraph 5.3.5:</p>
<blockquote>
If a background image is specified, the value of 'background-attachment' determines if it is fixed with regard to the canvas or if it scrolls along with the content.
</blockquote><p>
This is correct in this page, where this value is set to 'fixed'. The problem is with the background-repeat property. This is set to 'no-repeat' here. This normally works when it is specified for the &lt;body> element, but not if it is overridden in a subelement, such as &lt;h1> in this page. 
Only for a very small canvas size, should the image be visible in this page. However it is visible for all canvas sizes.
</p><p>Mozilla does handle this correctly.
