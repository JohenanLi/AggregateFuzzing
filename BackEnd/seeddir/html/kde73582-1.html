Hello all!

In my "other life", when I'm not working with the HierMenus dude, I design and develop web content
for HP LaserJet Printers. Up until now, KHTML has been able to render the XHTML that I use to draw
some of my tabs just fine with the exception of some minor z-index issues (described in bug
43546).

However, KHTML from current CVS has some more serious issues with this tabs. I've attached a quick
XHTML test case.

The basic problem seems to be that &lt;a&gt; tags with margins seem to be mucking around with the
relative positioning of &lt;img&gt; elements surrounding them. In the test case, if you remove the
margin-left and margin-right CSS rules from a.hpSelectedTabLabel, then the tab renders as it
should - sans the margins of course.

For what it's worth, I think Safari (pre 1.0) had this problem as well. Safari 1.0 did not have
the problem, but I have no idea what they did to fix it.


If someone could look at this, I would greatly appreciate it and perhaps even buy beer/soda/pizza
for whomever fixes the problem. There are a *lot* of LaserJets out there with this code and I
don't want their web pages to look goofy in Konqueror - especially since they used to work.

Also, if there is anything else that I can do to help debug the problem, please let me know.

Best regards,

David
