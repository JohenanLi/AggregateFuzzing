  <a name="building"><b>General</b></a>
</h3>

<ul>

   <li>
   <p>
      <u>System variable requirement</u><br>
      The configure process requires that the system variables CC and CXX point to 
      the correct version of C and C++ compilers, for example gcc and g++, . 
   </p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <p>
      <u>autoconf</u><br>
      In case you want to change configure.in, you will need now autoconf version 2.53 to 
      create the configure script.
   </p>
   </li>

   <li>
   <p>
      <u>Windows build</u><br>
	The windows build experience was improved and should be easier to go through now.
      <ul>
	<li>
		Up-to-date cygwin are now required to run the configure script. The 
		no longer supported historical version "b20" is also no longer supported to build Openoffice.org. 
		The cygwin tools are available at <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">
		www.cygwin.com</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		As a new requirement,  parts of the February 2003 version of the Microsoft Platfrom SDK
		have to be installed, in particular the MDAC SDK, the Core SDK and the Internet
		Development SDK. You can download this from
    		<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/">
    		http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate</a>.
		The location of the MS PSDK on your system can be passed to configure with the 
		--with-psdk-home option, if configure doesn't find it by itself. 
  	</li>
	<li>
		As a consequence of the above, the previous requirements of downloading and copying 
		the header files AdoCtint.h and SqlUcode.h into external/downloads is no longer 
		necessary. Newer versions of these headers are part of the MS PSDK. Note that 
		the patches for these files in external/ado and external/odbc had to be 
		adjusted. This has been taken care of in the new sources. 
	</li>
	<li>
		All these changes are described in detail in the build documentation, available at 
		<a href="http://tools.openoffice.org/dev_docs/build_windows.html">
		http://tools.openoffice.org/dev_docs/build_windows.html</a>.

	</li>
	<p></p>
	<li>
		<b>Experimental:</b> Instead of using the proprietary 4NT Software you can now use the tcsh
		shell from the cygwin tools to build Openoffice.org. This is described in an extra build
		documentation only for the tcsh case at:
		<a href="http://tools.openoffice.org/dev_docs/build_windows_tcsh.html">
		http://tools.openoffice.org/dev_docs/build_windows_tcsh.html</a>.
	</li>

	</ul>
   <p></p>
   </li>

   <li>
   <p>
      <u>Solaris/sparc</u><br>
      The Solaris/sparc version needs the following patches:
      <ul>
	<li>
	   If you have Solaris 8 (sparc), patches 108434-01 and 108435-01
	</li>
	<li>
	   The patches are available at
           <a href="http://sunsolve.sun.com">sunsolve.sun.com</a>.
           <ul>
		Instructions:
		<li>
		   Search for the appropriate patch numbers and download
		</li>
		<li>
		   Uncompress the files
		</li>
		<li>
		   cd to the directory containing the patches
		</li>
		<li>
		   As root, execute the following: <br>
		   <pre>prompt> patchadd [patchnumber]</pre>
		</li>
	   </ul>
	</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
	<p>It is suggested that you use one of the following compilers for building on Solaris/Sparc:</P>
	<ul>
		<li>Forte C++ 6 Update 1
		<li>Forte C++ 6 Update 2
		<li>Forte C++ 7
	</ul>
   <li>
	<p><u>Linux</u></p>
	<ul>
		<li>You should use gcc version 3.0.x (x > 0) or gcc 3.2.x 
		<li>You can use a bash shell instead of tcsh - in which case you should use the LinuxIntelEnv.Set.sh file for setting up teh environment
		<li>gtk+ 2.0 is required to build the crash reporter
	</ul>

   </li>
