<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-left: 0.59in">&ldquo;<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Equal
	opportunity&rdquo; means that state funded or sponsored programs and
	activities have to be conducted in such a way as to assure an
	opportunity for people with disabilities even if in fact it's
	&ldquo;known&rdquo;&nbsp; (de jure discrimination) that no one who
	is disabled will &ldquo;in fact&rdquo; participate.</FONT></P>

	with disabilities have to be given opportunities to meaningfully
	participate through all aspects of a program, not just certain
	parts.</FONT></P>

	cannot avoid responsibility for compliance by partnering, or hiding
	behind a third-party contract provider, for services with agencies
	or actors who in turn discriminate against people with disabilities.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-left: 0.59in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Always
	check program descriptions, on flyers and brochures for example, to
	be sure they express some explicit and written or otherwise
	communicated facts and status about reasonable accommodation. After
	all, the brochure is the beginning of equal access, based on
	informing ALL members of the public.</FONT></P>
