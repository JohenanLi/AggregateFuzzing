  <h3>Why is the issue marked FIXED when I still see the bug in the latest version?</h3>

  <p>The life cycle of an issue has several stages, and FIXED does not automatically mean
  that the fix for the problem is really available in the latest snapshot version. Instead,
  if an issue is marked as FIXED, then it just means that the developer
  checked in the fix - it doesn't imply the fix is available in a snapshot</p>

  <p>Developers work on branches only (so-called <a href="http://tools.openoffice.org" target="_blank">child
  workspaces</a> or CWS</a>), while the snapshot is made from cvs-HEAD. FIXED only means the fix
  made it into a CWS, within any information when it will be publicly available.</p>

  <p>If you want to see the status of the CWS where an issue is fixed,
    <ul><li>go to <a href="http://eis.services.openoffice.org">http://eis.services.openoffice.org</a></li>
        <li>log on as guest</li>
        <li>in the menu, select "Child Workspaces" and "Search"
        <li>enter the number of the issue, preceded by an "i" (for instance "i12345" to search
            for issue 12345) into the "TaskId" field</li>
        <li>press the "Find" button</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>This will give you a list of CWS' to which the respective task has been added to (usually exactly
  one). Also, administrative information about the CWS is shown, the most interesting being the
  "Milestone (integrated)" column. Only if you have a snapshot with a milestone number greater or equal
  to the one shown here, you can expect the bug to be fixed.</p>

  <p>Note that if the "Milestone (integrated)" field is empty for the CWS you found, this simply means
  the fix is not yet available in any snapshot.</p>

  <p>If all of the above is too much to know for you, the easy rule is: If a bug is CLOSED, it should
  be fixed in a snapshot. If it's only FIXED, don't expect anything.<br/>
  The reasoning is in the task handling policies, as written down on the <a href="http://qa.openoffice.org/issue_handling/">
  QA pages</a>, in particular in
  <a href="http://qa.openoffice.org/issue_handling/workflowcharts/taskhandling_workflow_issuetracker_fix_close.html">A Bug's lifetime</a>.</p>
