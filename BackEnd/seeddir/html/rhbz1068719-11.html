		</span><br> 
We are meeting at the new Caf&#233; Mooch in Padiham from 7.15 for brews and cake. Our topic this month is eating disorders and the booklet is called 'The Quest for Thinness'.  We will also be joined by a mental health nurse who works with teenagers with eating disorders who will be able to give us some practical advice and pointers to spot and deal with the issue if we need to.  Please do join us. I think I was writing here and including some ' of these apostrophe c










I continued typing after the above line - something like:  cat's and such as dog's and if I keep typing other drivel 

At this point bluefish was killed without a report from abrt. When I re-opened the file the last sentence above had not been saved - the text ended "apostrophe c"  above.
