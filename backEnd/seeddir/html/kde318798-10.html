<div dir="ltr">Using poppler, examine the file and read a &quot;copy&quot; as text into a database. Make the annotations. Then again using poppler, read the annotated file.

As long as the annotation still exists with its unique identifier, I can pull the content out of the pdf via a python script and supply okular with a command line argument to open the file at the correct location.<div><br></div><div>It would be simpler if the pdf reader supplied the Object Identifier as part of what is visible about the annotation.</div><div><br></div><div>Chris</div></div><div class="gmail_extra"><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Tue, Feb 10, 2015 at 12:44 PM, Albert Astals Cid <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:aacid@kde.org" target="_blank">aacid@kde.org</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex"><a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=318798" target="_blank">https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=318798</a><br>

Veeeeeeery long text, you&#39;re still not telling me how you as a user are going<br>
to tell in the command line which annotation you want to open, are you going to<br>
tell me &quot;182 2&quot; so i open generation 2 of object 182? How are you even going to<br>
know the anotation you want it&#39;s object 182?<br>
