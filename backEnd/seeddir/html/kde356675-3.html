&gt;--- Comment #2 from Josef Weidendorfer &lt;josef.weidendorfer@gmx.de&gt; ---
&gt;Can you provide the complete output of the crash?
&gt;As the patch is about VG core stuff, I assume the crash also happens with other
&gt;VG tools?
&gt;If so, It seems better to re-assign this to "general" component.
